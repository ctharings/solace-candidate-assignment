   - Environment-based configuration
   - Improved caching mechanism

2. **Type Safety**
   - Centralized type definitions
   - Enum-based constants
   - Enhanced type inference
   - Improved component prop typing
   - Better error handling with types

3. **Performance**
   - Server-side rendering
   - Optimized data fetching
   - Improved caching
   - Better component structure
   - Reduced client-side JavaScript
